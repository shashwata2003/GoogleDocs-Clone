# About the Project:
The Google Docs Clone project on GitHub is a React-based web application developed with the integration of Firebase 9, TailwindCSS, and Draft.js. 
It aims to replicate the key functionalities of Google Docs, providing users with a collaborative platform for creating and editing documents, 
spreadsheets, and presentations in real-time. The project utilizes the powerful capabilities of React to deliver a dynamic and responsive user interface, 
while Firebase 9 handles the backend infrastructure, including authentication, real-time data synchronization, and cloud storage. TailwindCSS is employed 
for efficient styling and customization, ensuring a visually appealing and modern design. Additionally, Draft.js is leveraged to implement rich text
editing and formatting features. With this technology stack, the Google Docs Clone project offers a comprehensive and efficient solution for online 
document collaboration and editing.
